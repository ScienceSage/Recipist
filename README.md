Recipist is a Web and Android application that helps college students find 
recipes to make using the ingredients that they currently have. The app records

## Vision Statement
Make cooking less of a chore by reducing trips to the grocery store.

## Motivation
We have the issue of not knowing what food we can make with the ingredients on hand most nights a week. This app will help us alleviate some of our pain by searching for and displaying a diversity of food to make.

## Risks
* Most of us don’t know each other
* Different schedules so team meetings are difficult 
* Most of us don’t know Java or SQL
* Never built a phone app
* Most have never worked on project this large

## Mitigation strategies
* Get to know each other better (try for more in person meetings)
* Specialization of languages
  * Two sub-groups
    * One for backend (python, SQL)
    * One for frontend (Java)
* Do research on how android app architecture works
* Learn (at least basics of) relevant languages before starting
* Keep good contact using slack.
